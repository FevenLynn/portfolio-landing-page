I am enjoying the journey so far, it has proved to be demanding requires interaction with peers for collaborative learning, and problem analysis and solving skills. I am a trained accountant andd specifically a trained tax administrator. Being a tax administrator involves identifying inconsistencies and solving them whenever necessary. </p>

    <p>As I am a new developer, with limited links to projects I have worked on, here are some website links and descriptions for sites that I love and interact with oftenly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Spotify: Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers with over 406 million monthly active users, including 180 million paying subscribers, as of December 2021. I listen to podcasts on Spotify. </li>
        <li> The CSS Zen Garden is a World Wide Web development resource "built to demonstrate what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design." Style sheets contributed by graphic designers from around the world are used to change the visual presentation of a single HTML file, producing hundreds of different designs. Aside from reference to an external CSS file, the HTML markup itself never changes. All visual differences are the result of the CSS. </li>
        <li> Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. </li>
