## Project Description

- This is my Portfolio, where I will showcase my work as I progress in my developer journey. All the projects I wil complete will be included here for my instructors, collaborators or potential employers to look at. For now, the sites listed are those of sites I often interact with. The Portfolio will be oftenly updated with projects I will complete as I learn and grow as a developer.

## User Stories:

- User should be able to get enough professional information about me and my capabiities.
- User should look at sample projects that I have completed and get a description of what the project entails and the languages used.

- Be able to access live links to the projects I have completed with adequate information on them.
